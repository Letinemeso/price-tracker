"data.config" is a file for setting configuration for a program.
it can look like this:

delay{2000}
output{file.txt}
website
{
	link{https://www.avito.ru/sankt-peterburg/avtomobili/mazda/cx-5-ASgBAgICAkTgtg3mmCjitg2Uoyg?cd=1&radius=0}
	chunk{цена от ***** руб.}
}
website
{
	link{https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/03/01/imagining-a-thread-safe-curl_global_init/}
	chunk{<h2>*****</h2>}
}
website{...}
...



here is description of availible properties:
	delay - sets delay (in milliseconds) between requests (it is not recomended to set low settings due to possible block on website)

	output - sets output file (or type in COUT to make program use standart output (console))

	website - unlimited (ish) property which sets website data to request

	link - well, a link for a GET request to website

	chunk - some chunk of data, which will be attempted to be found. ***** is a part which will be extracted and printed / stored to file



program itself has a very simple menu which consists of 3 commands:
	start - start downloading and parsing data from websites, specified in config
	
	stop - kinda obvious

	exit - also
